# 5.0
- Updated mods
- Added Utilitarian, removed all of the added blocks and items from this mod, we only want the message suppresion
- Mekanism alpha message now disabled 
- Tweaked Miner structure validation, allowed blocks on top of the miners are now limited to blocks in the "#non_controller_blocks" tag. This provides a significant improvement to the miners. If you feel there a block that should be allowed let me know and I will add it!
